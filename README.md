# dsPIC33 MotorBench Reference Projects

This repository contains reference MPLAB X projects targeting the **dsPIC33EP256MC506** microcontroller. The projects were generated with MPLAB XIDE 6.23 and MPLAB Code Configuratior tool and demonstrate basic peripheral usage of the PWM on the **MCLV‑2** development board.

## Project

| `PWM-X2C-EXAMPLE.X` | Minimal example that enables PWM and blinks the on‑board LED. Useful as a starting point for experimenting with the PWM module. |


## Usage

1. Install [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide) and the appropriate XC16 compiler.
2. Open the desired `.X` project from within the IDE or build it using its provided makefile:
3. Program the file to a dsPIC33EP256MC506 PIM mounted on the MCLV‑2 board.
